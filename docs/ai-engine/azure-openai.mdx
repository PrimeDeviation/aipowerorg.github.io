# Azure

## Bring Your Own Key Model

Our plugin operates on a *Bring Your Own Key* basis, which means it serves as a **bridge between your WordPress site and Azure OpenAI services.**.

In order to use our plugin, you need to have an Azure account and purchase API credits from Azure.

With this approach, users are required to provide their own Azure API key to access the plugin's functionality. This ensures that users maintain full control over their API keys and guarantees access to the latest, most advanced language processing technology offered by Azure OpenAI.

:::info

Purchasing our plugin does not provide any credit from Azure.

When you buy our plugin, you gain access to the [pro features](docs/intro/pro.md) of the plugin, but it does not include any API credit.

You will still need to purchase credit from Azure separately.

You can refer to their [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) for more details.

## How to Generate an Azure OpenAI API Key

Azure OpenAI Service is a powerful tool integrated into the Azure ecosystem. Here's how you can get started with it:

### Registration
Azure OpenAI Service, despite being generally available, still requires users to register. Microsoft might restrict access based on availability and other eligibility criteria.

### Application Process
- Visit [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).
- Click on the `Apply Now` button.
- Complete the form that appears. Make sure to use your work email address; personal emails like Gmail or Hotmail might decrease your chances of approval.

### Awaiting Approval
After submission, Microsoft will review your request. Once approved, they will inform you about the access.

### Accessing Azure Portal
- Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- Click on "Create a Resource".

<img src={AzureResource1} />

- In the search bar, type "OpenAI". Select Azure OpenAI from the search results.
- Click on `Create Azure OpenAI`. This action will initiate the creation of a resource for you.

- After the resource is created, select it. On the left menu, look for "Keys and Endpoint" under the Resource Management section.

<img src={KeysEndpoint} />

- Here, you can find your Azure OpenAI API keys and endpoint. Click the copy icon to copy the API key.

### Setting Up AI Power Plugin
- Go to the AI Power plugin on your WordPress dashboard.
- Navigate to `Settings` > `AI Engine` tab.
- From the dropdown list, select `Azure`. This action will present four new fields:
  1. Azure API key
  2. Azure Endpoint
  3. Azure Deployment
  4. Azure Embeddings
  
The first three fields are mandatory, while the last one is optional (but required if you're using embeddings).

- Fill in your API key and endpoint.
- Now, navigate to [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com) and log in.
- From the left menu, click on `Models`. This will display all the models available to deploy.

:::info

Not all models can be deployed; only those marked "Yes" under "Deployable" can be.

:::

### Deploying a Model
- From the models list, select a deployable model.

<img src={BaseModels} />

- Click the `Deploy` button at the top.

<img src={DeployModel} />

- In the modal window, specify the base model, model version, and deployment name.
- Click `Deploy`.
- After deployment, copy the deployment name and paste it into the plugin under `Settings` > `AI Engine` tab.
  
For embeddings, select the `text-embedding-ada-002` model and deploy it. Once deployed, copy its name and paste it in the plugin's relevant field.

### Save Settings
Once all fields are populated, click the `Save` button in the plugin.

## Limitations

Before setting Azure as your provider in the plugin, you should be aware of its limitations:

- **Unsupported Modules**: Fine-tuning and Audio Converter.

Once you enable Azure:

1. **Speech to Text**: This feature will be disabled because Whisper is not yet available on Azure. However, we plan to integrate it once it becomes available.
2. **Moderation**: Azure offers its own content filtering, so our plugin will automatically disable the moderation feature.
3. **Image Generator**: Azure only allows up to 5 images maximum whereas OpenAI allows up to 10 images.
