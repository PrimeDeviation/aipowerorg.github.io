# Model Configuration

When our plugin is installed for the first time, it comes with **Davinci** as the default model.

However you can change it by selecting it from the **Model** dropdown in the **AI Engine** tab.

:::info

Please be aware that the **Express Mode** in Content Writer and **Auto Content Writer** both use the models set in the **Settings - AI Engine** tab. Any changes made here will apply to both modules.

## Changing the GPT Model

Here are the steps:

- First, navigate to the plugin menu on your WordPress dashboard.
- Click on the **Settings** page and look for the **AI Engine** tab.

- Click on the **Model** dropdown menu to reveal the available GPT models that you can choose from.
- Select your desired model from the list by clicking on it.
- After selecting your model, click on the **Save** button to save your changes.
- Your GPT model will now be changed to the one you selected.

:::info

GPT-4 is currently in limited beta, which means that access to the GPT-4 API from OpenAI is available only through a waiting list and is not open to everyone yet. You can sign up for the waiting list [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).

:::

:::caution

If you don't have GPT-4 API access and if you select GPT-4 or GPT-4K-32K as your model then you will get *"The model: gpt-4 does not exist"* or *"The model: gpt-4-32k does not exist"* error.

## Syncing with the Latest OpenAI Models

You may notice a **Sync** button located next to the model dropdown. This button is used to synchronize the plugin with the most recent version of the OpenAI models. So if OpenAI releases a new model, you can use this button to update the plugin to use the new model.

If your organization has fine-tuned any models on specific datasets, you can easily find them under the Model dropdown.

## Rate Limit Buffer

Our plugin provides a feature named **Rate Limit Buffer** that is specifically designed for users who select GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models. This feature appears as a dropdown menu and is only visible when either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 has been chosen.

With options ranging from 1 to 10 seconds, Rate Limit Buffer allows for a *brief pause* before initiating another API call.

This delay is necessary due to the [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) imposed by OpenAI for these particular models.

If you encounter a rate limit error from OpenAI, consider using this feature.

We recommend starting with a minimum sleep time of 1 second and incrementally increasing it until you achieve an optimal balance between responsiveness and avoiding rate limit errors.
