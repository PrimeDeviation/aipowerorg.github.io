# Model Comparison

The Comparison Tool under the **Content Writer - Comparison** tab in the AI Power WordPress plugin enables users to compare the outputs of up to six different language models.

This powerful feature lets you experiment with the models and tweak various parameters to fine-tune the output according to your needs.

## How to Use the Comparison Tool

Follow the steps outlined below to make the most of the Comparison Tool.

- **Navigate to the Comparison Tool**: In your WordPress dashboard, go to the AI Power plugin and click on the **Content Writer - Comparison** tab.
- **Select the Models**: From each model dropdown, select the models you want to compare. The options include GPT-3.5, GPT-4, DaVinci, Ada, etc. You can choose different models for each comparison window, up to six.

- **Select or Create a Prompt**: Use the prompt dropdown to select a ready-to-use prompt. Once selected, it will be appended to the text area below. If you prefer, you can modify the selected prompt or write your own.
- **Adjust Parameters**: For each model, adjust the parameters to suit your needs. The parameters you can adjust include max tokens, temperature, top_p, fp, and pp.
- **Generate Output**: Click the **Generate** button for each model window. If you are comparing four models, for example, you will need to hit the **Generate** button four times.
