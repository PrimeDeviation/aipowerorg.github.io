# Top_P

## What is Top_P?

An alternative to sampling with temperature is called **nucleus sampling**, in which the model only takes into account the tokens with the highest probability mass (as determined by the **top_p** parameter).

For example, a value of 0.1 means that only the tokens with the top **10% probability** mass are considered.

OpenAI generally recommends to **use either temperature sampling or nucleus sampling, but not both.**

You can adjust your **top_p** value in settings page of our plugin as shown below.
