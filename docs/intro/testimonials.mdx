    <h3>Amazing user-friendly tech that elevated my website - <span style={{ color: 'gold' }}>★★★★★</span></h3>
    <p>
It’s a fantastic plugin!<br/><br/>

My initial aim was to integrate some advanced AI features onto my site, but as someone who doesn’t know anything about AI programming I didn’t think I could. But AI Power was as easy as installing any other plugin, and just like that, my website was AI-powered. The functionality has been flawless.
    
What truly stands out, though, is their support service. On my first AI project I didn’t really know how to go about it – no fault of the plugin, just my own confusion – and the support team responded immediately, going above and beyond with their assistance, practically configuring the whole project for me. Their customer service is top-tier, and it made my whole experience with AI easy.
    
And now my website is cutting edge! (thanks to AI Power)

    <h3>AI forms changed my life - <span style={{ color: 'gold' }}>★★★★★</span></h3>
    <p>I wanted to build small apps powered with chatGPT to help my clients with their marketing.<br/><br/>

When it came to website integration or app development, it was a nightmare.

When I discovered AI power pack, I could build my own forms with my own prompts to integrate my apps on my website in seconds.

This is a powerful tool and I am quite sure I am still not aware of all it will bring to my business.

    <h3>The most amaing plugin in WordPress - <span style={{ color: 'gold' }}>★★★★★</span></h3>
    <p>This is truly a plugin, I’m really impressed with. It just produced 15 professional blog entries within 45 minutes. It’s amazing. <br/><br/>

I also found out how to teach the plugin to the website as well. I want to all important pages and explained what it was.

I also went to the shop and explained what each virtual) product was, how it’s going to be implemented and what the work actually is (presented by the virtual product in the shop).

Then I added new functionality, so that it only enriches my ‘hand-made’ blog entries with handy things like FAQs, external and internal references!

And here I hit a snag, or two snags, actually. Its knowledge is too old (from 2018!) and the internal links were dummies. Maybe wishful thinking, but the actual URLs were all wrong. But I looked at the titles of those references and they truly made sense. So I let it generate the blog entries itself, and voila, great additional posts.

It’s scary to work with the AI. I ask it more complex questions, and guess what? It delivers. I understand with all of that that most people working in offices will be replaced by AI. Also, all medical doctors and professors and many researchers. Actually, everyone working with at lest a high-school diploma can be replaced. And that includes designers and programmers too, especially the scripters and coders.

As I said, scary. In the next two-three years we’ll see it happen, count my words.

The future of WordPress is very clear to me. If they incorporate the AI into the WP engine, many people will be without a job and creating a website is something easy to do and finished within a couple of hours.

    <h3>Great Plugin, Minimal Learning Curve - <span style={{ color: 'gold' }}>★★★★★</span></h3>
    <p>No issues so far. Lots of features in the free version, but planning to upgrade soon. There are no plugin conflicts or site slow-down that I can determine; I’m using a paid caching plugin, and (so far) I’m using this plugin only on the backend. The ability to adjust the prompts is great! Kudos to the dev 🙌<br/><br/>

    <h3>Don’t get it - <span style={{ color: 'gold' }}>★★★★★</span></h3>
    <p>Don’t get it, don’t install it. And if you do, don’t talk about it. You’ll give away all the secret competitive advantages and pretty soon, everyone will offer listening and talking AI bots on their sites. So just keep quiet.<br/><br/>
