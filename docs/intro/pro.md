# Why Upgrade to Pro?

The AI Power Pro Plan offers several distinct benefits over the Free Plan. Here's why you should consider upgrading:

## 1. Priority Email Support
One of the most significant benefits of the Pro Plan is the priority email support. If you ever encounter any issues or have any questions about the AI Power plugin, you'll receive dedicated support from our expert team. Your queries will be given priority, ensuring that you receive quick and efficient help when you need it most.

## 2. Early Access to New Features
As a Pro Plan user, you'll enjoy the privilege of early access to new features. This means you'll be the first to explore and benefit from the innovative enhancements and improvements we continuously introduce to our AI Power plugin.

## 3. RSS Module
The Pro Plan unlocks access to the RSS Module. This feature empowers you to automatically pull article titles from any RSS feed and import them into your WordPress website. The module can generate content based on these RSS titles, significantly reducing your content creation workload and saving you invaluable time and effort.

## 4. Google Sheets Compatibility
The Pro Plan comes with Google Sheets compatibility, providing a seamless way to generate content from a Google Sheets document. This feature is especially handy for collaborative content creation and management.

## 5. Post Scheduling
Post Scheduling is an invaluable tool for any content creator. It allows you to schedule your posts ahead of time, ensuring that your content is always fresh and up-to-date. With the Pro Plan, you can schedule your posts and let AI Power handle the rest.

## 6. Enhanced AutoGPT Capabilities
Upgrading to the Pro Plan significantly expands your Auto Content Writer capabilities, allowing you to process up to 100 posts per batch whereas the Free Plan can only generate content for 5 posts at a time in a batch. Therefore, by choosing the Pro Plan, you're enhancing your content generation capacity by 20 times, significantly increasing your productivity and efficiency.

## 7. Keyword Management
The Pro Plan opens up a suite of advanced keyword management tools that provide you with greater control over your content generation:

1. **Ability to Add Keywords:** You can add specific keywords to guide the content generation process, ensuring your content is always relevant and targeted.

2. **Ability to Avoid Certain Keywords:** If there are certain terms or phrases you want to exclude from your content, the Pro Plan allows you to specify these for avoidance. This ensures that your content aligns perfectly with your brand voice and messaging.

3. **Ability to Make Keywords Bold:** Highlight important keywords by making them bold. This not only makes your content more reader-friendly but also allows you to emphasize key points effectively.

## 8. Inclusion of FAQ Content
Under the Pro Plan, you have the ability to integrate Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) directly into your content. This feature allows you to address common queries and provide relevant information to your audience within the context of your posts. By including FAQs, you enhance your content's value, improve user engagement, and potentially boost your SEO performance by answering search queries directly in your content.


## 9. Chat Bot Moderation
With the Pro Plan, you gain access to advanced moderation features for the chat bot. This means you can better manage user interactions, maintaining a positive and constructive environment on your website.

## 10. Custom Post Types for Embeddings
With the Pro Plan, you gain the capability to embed your custom post types. This unique feature means that you can feed any custom content directly into the bot. As a result, your chatbot becomes more personalized and context-aware, being able to reference your own custom content during interactions.
