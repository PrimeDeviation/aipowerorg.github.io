# SEO

If youâ€™re looking to improve the SEO of your website, one important step is to ensure that all of your posts have a well-written meta description.

Meta description provides a brief summary of the content of your post, and are often displayed by search engines and social media platforms when your post is shared.

## Enable or Disable Meta Description Generation

This feature allows you to automatically generate concise and informative meta descriptions for your content.

A well-crafted meta description helps improve search engine visibility, provide an overview of your content, and attract the attention of potential readers.

- Go to **Settings - SEO** in the plugin menu and find the **Meta Description** section.
- Enable it by checking the box next to it, or disable it by unchecking the box.
- Click **Save** to apply your choice.

<img src={Meta} width="700" />

From now on, whenever you create content in Content Writer - Express Mode, a meta description will be generated by GPT automatically under the SEO tab if the option is enabled. You can then copy and use it as needed.

## Meta Description in HTML

Many WordPress users already use popular SEO tools to generate their own meta tags, so we have added an option for you to choose whether or not to include a meta description in the HTML code of your post.

If you uncheck this feature, the meta description will still be generated but not injected into the HTML code. You can copy and paste it into the meta description field instead.

However, if you're not using any SEO plugin, you can simply check this feature and the meta tag will be inserted automatically.

- Find the **Include in HTML** checkbox in the **Settings - SEO** tab.
- Enable or disable the insertion of the generated meta description into the HTML code by checking or unchecking the box next to it.
- Click **Save** to apply your choice.

<img src={MetaHTML} width="700" />

:::tip

Using the same meta description for multiple pages can negatively impact your SEO efforts. Search engines value unique content, so always create distinct and relevant meta descriptions for each page to optimize your search engine rankings.

**Example**

**Title**: Mobile Phones

**Generated Meta Description**: Mobile phones are electronic devices that allow you to make calls, send text messages, and browse the internet.

If you check your HTML code, you will see the following meta description:

```html
--- This meta description generated by AI Power Plugin ---

<meta name="description" content="Mobile phones are electronic devices that allow you to make calls, send text messages, and browse the internet.">
<meta name="og:description" content="Mobile phones are electronic devices that allow you to make calls, send text messages, and browse the internet.">
```

<img src={MathRank} width="700" />

This option allows our plugin to automatically update the meta fields in the corresponding SEO plugin whenever a meta description is generated for your content.

For example, if you have Math Rank installed and enabled on your website, you will see an additional checkbox option labeled **Update Math Rank Meta** under the **Settings - SEO** tab.
