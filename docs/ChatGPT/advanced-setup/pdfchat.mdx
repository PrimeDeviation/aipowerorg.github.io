You will notice a PDF icon appearing next to the microphone button. This allows users to upload PDF files directly in the chat interface.

## Viewing Uploaded PDFs

As an admin, you have the ability to access and manage the PDFs uploaded by your users.

All user-uploaded PDFs can be found under the **ChatGPT - Uploaded PDFs** tab in your dashboard.

<img src={uploadedpdfs} width="700" />

From this tab, you can view all the PDFs that have been uploaded and embedded by users.

This is a convenient way to keep track of the documents being interacted with on your platform.

Moreover, you have the option to delete any of these PDFs if you no longer want to keep them in your index.

This gives you control over the content that remains accessible to your users through the chat interface.

:::tip

To maintain a clear distinction between your website content and user-uploaded PDFs, you can create separate bots for each type of content and assign each bot a different index.

By doing this, you can ensure that your chatbot accurately retrieves and delivers the appropriate information to your users.

This is particularly helpful if you do not want your website content to mix with the content from user-uploaded PDFs.

:::

By managing your user-uploaded content effectively, you can ensure that your chatbot continues to provide accurate and relevant responses, while maintaining the integrity and security of your platform.
