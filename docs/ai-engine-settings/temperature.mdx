# Temperature

## What is Temperature?

Temperature is an important setting in GPT that has a **significant impact** on the output of the system. It controls the amount of **randomness** in the output, and can be adjusted to achieve different results.

At lower temperatures, GPT will tend to choose words with a higher probability of occurrence, which can be useful when you want the system to **complete a sentence** or phrase with a single correct answer.

On the other hand, higher temperatures can be used to generate ideas or tell stories, as they will produce a greater **variety** of responses.

It's important to note that while some people refer to temperature as a **creativity** setting, official documentation **does not recommend this label**. Creativity is a more complex concept than simply increasing the level of randomness in the output.

To get the most out of GPT, it's important to understand how temperature works and how to adjust it to achieve your desired results. So, it's worth spending some time understanding and adjusting the temperature setting to get the most out of GPT.

OpenAI generally recommends altering this or **top_p** but not both.

## How to Adjust Temperature Settings

When our plugin is installed for the first time, it comes with **0.7** as the default Temperature value.

However you can change it from the **Temperature** field in the **AI Engine** tab.

Here are the steps:

- First, navigate to the plugin menu on your WordPress dashboard.
- Click on the **Settings** page and look for the **AI Engine** tab.
- Enter a new value in Temperature field.

- Click on the **Save** button to save your changes.

This value typically works well for most use cases. However, if you wish to modify the temperature, you can do so. The minimum value is **0**, and the maximum value is **1**. If you attempt to input a value outside this range, you will receive the following message: *"Please enter a valid temperature value between 0 and 1."*

Feel free to experiment with different values until you find the optimal setting.
